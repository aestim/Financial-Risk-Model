📌 OverviewThis project is a Machine Learning-based financial risk analysis model developed to assess the creditworthiness and financial health of US publicly traded companies. The core objective is to leverage key financial statement data extracted from SEC 10-K/10-Q filings to predict the likelihood of financial distress (bankruptcy) and inform fundamental investment valuation.🚀 Project GoalsDevelop a Financial Distress Prediction Model: Build a classification model that predicts the short-term probability of a company entering financial distress using derived financial ratios as features.Utilize the Z''-Score as Foundation: Implement and extensively utilize the Altman Z''-Score model's components as the initial screening tool and as key features within the machine learning pipeline to establish a strong basis for bankruptcy risk assessment.Data-Driven Credit Assessment: Provide a preemptive, objective, and data-driven risk indicator that complements traditional credit rating methodologies.🛠️ Core Component: The Altman Z''-Score ($Z''$)The Z''-Score is selected as the foundational metric for this model due to its broader applicability across all industrial sectors (not limited to manufacturing), making it ideal for the diverse universe of US publicly traded companies.Step 1: Accurately extract and process the necessary five financial variables ($X_1$ to $X_5$) from 10-K/10-Q filings.Step 2: Calculate the $Z''$-Score to classify firms into zones of credit risk: Safe Zone, Grey Zone, and Distress Zone. This provides the baseline for defining the target variable (financial distress) for the ML model.$$Z'' = 6.56X_1 + 3.26X_2 + 6.72X_3 + 1.05X_4$$
